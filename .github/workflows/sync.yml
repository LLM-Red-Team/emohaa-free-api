            Due to a change in the workflow file of the LLM-Red-Team/emohaa-free-api upstream repository, GitHub has automatically suspended the scheduled automatic update. You need to manually sync your fork. Please refer to the detailed [Tutorial][tutorial-en-US] for instructions.

            由于 LLM-Red-Team/emohaa-free-api 上游仓库的 workflow 文件变更，导致 GitHub 自动暂停了本次自动更新，你需要手动 Sync Fork 一次，
